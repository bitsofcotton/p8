# p8
The combination of the predictions.

# Description
If we take {0,1,2}-valued function as maximum variables, we get up to 16 depth tri-color tree.
So we decompose input stream to such structures with inverse with context-depend compressions, then, predict with leaf is pseudo Lebesgue measurable continuous ones.

# Why we need this
Once p0 has a almost complete prediction on the stream, the selection of the hypothesis continuous had be switched we think (or, our terminal is infected).
So if this is the switch from the world itself, we think this can be the second one with using the world compression observation context if they're variable.

# The hypothesis this condition
We make the hypothesis there's no tanglement on variable to variable, so they're completely separable, however, the value itself has some of the representations on the number as a context.

Also, we make the hypothesis represented leaf of them are enough Lebesgue measurable continuous ones.

# Don't implement now
Because p1+p0 has half compatible to this structure, and this can break some of the continuous condition on the world, we don't implement this structure.

# Ongoing our end of the implementation
This is the p\*-series our end of the implementation if randtools is enough meaningful.

# Might be our end of the implementation
Without making hypothesis on the internal status on function made stream, there's variables on the hypothesis {1,x,f(x),status}, in some condition this is reduced into {x,f(x)}.
The latter one we treat with the p0, p1 for maximum dimension on the stream of the matrix rank.
The former one we treat also with p4, p7 adding to p0, p1. In the matrix rank meaning.

So to continue p\*-series is to enname some series of the vector set on prediction, but these are max rank, we end with this.

Treating the internal status on somewhat larger separated one and to make the hypothesis the structure is simple enough, the p3 is our end of the implementation. So if we implement p3 and there's some high complexity structure on their internal states, p3 will be the better choice for us, however, in {x,f(x)} meaning, they should compatible to our p0, p1.

So this is our end, and open for implementation.
Also, I'm doubting our companion computer structure's consistency, this is also opposite site open for implementation.
